1. To Create a New Brach
  $ git branch test (you can choose any name you want. But of course it is better to be related to the project )

2. To Switch an existing Brach 
  $ git checkout main (you will be switching  in branch main here)

3. If you type "git log" command, the pointer will point always by default to 
  main/master branch. And it will not show other branches. To see all, "git log   --all" or just specific one "git log test"

4. To create a branch and switching to it at the same time. 
  $ git checkout -b <newbranchsname>
  or
  $ git switch test  (here is for already existing one)
  $ git switch -c <newbranchsname>

  4.1. To return previous one
   $ git switch -

5. To delete a branch 
  $ git branch -d <brancname>
